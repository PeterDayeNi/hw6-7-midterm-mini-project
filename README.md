Midterm Mini Project -- Kill the Bubbles

In this project, I am coding a game called "Kill the Bubbles". In this game, player will control the plane by pressing "up" and "down." Bubbles will keep showing up on the right side and move towards left. The plane will shoot bullets all the time. Once the bullets hit bubbles the bubbles will disapper. If the bubbles touch down the left side, game over.
